%% ==============================

The proposed framework was implemented as a comprehensive simulation using Python 3. The implementation focuses on modularity and extensibility, allowing for the simulation of complex hybrid work scenarios.

\subsection{Technology Stack}
The following technologies and libraries were used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python 3.9+}: Core programming language.
    \item \textbf{scikit-learn}: Used for implementing the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection.
    \item \textbf{Faker}: Used to generate realistic synthetic data for users (names, emails) and devices.
    \item \textbf{Pandas & NumPy}: Used for data manipulation and statistical analysis of simulation logs.
    \item \textbf{Matplotlib & Seaborn}: Used for generating visualization charts for the evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Modules}

\subsubsection{AI Engine (`core/ai_engine.py`)}
This module encapsulates the machine learning logic. The `BehavioralAnalyticsModel` class initializes the Isolation Forest model.
\begin{verbatim}
self.model = IsolationForest(
    n_estimators=100,
    contamination=0.1,
    random_state=42
)
\end{verbatim}
It includes methods for `train_user_model()` which fits the model on historical data, and `predict_anomaly_score()` which evaluates new events.

\subsubsection{Breach Simulator (`simulation/breach_simulator.py`)}
This module is critical for the comparative evaluation. It contains the logic for five distinct breach scenarios. For example, the `simulate_lateral_movement` function attempts to access a critical application from a compromised low-level account. In the ZTA implementation, this function checks for micro-segmentation policies before allowing the breach to succeed.

This script orchestrates the entire comparative study. It runs the simulation twice: first with ZTA controls disabled (Baseline) and then with them enabled (ZTA). It ensures a clean separation of training and testing data to avoid data leakage in the ML models.

\subsection{Simulation Execution Log}
The following screenshots provide a detailed trace of the simulation framework's execution, validating the functionality of each phase from initialization to final reporting.
